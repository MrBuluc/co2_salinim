# CARBON FOOTPRINT PROJECT

## Description and Motivation

We used the flutter framework for our project. It works with flutter commands on Android device or emulator easily. We used the provider package introduced by Google at IO 2018. We used to provider package for managing state between widgets. It was very helpful. In addition to taking advantage of many features of the dart language in the application provider, we also strongly integrated the provider package into the entire widget tree.
